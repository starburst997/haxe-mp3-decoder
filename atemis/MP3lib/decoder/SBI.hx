 * 06/01/07  Ported to ActionScript 3. By Jean-Denis Boivin

 *
 * 11/19/04	 1.0 moved to LGPL.
 * 
 * 18/06/01  Michael Scheerer,  Fixed bugs which causes
 *           negative indexes in method huffmann_decode and in method 
 *           dequanisize_sample.
 *
 * 16/07/01  Michael Scheerer, Catched a bug in method
 *           huffmann_decode, which causes an outOfIndexException.
 *           Cause : Indexnumber of 24 at SfBandIndex,
 *           which has only a length of 22. I have simply and dirty 
 *           fixed the index to <= 22, because I'm not really be able
 *           to fix the bug. The Indexnumber is taken from the MP3 
 *           file and the origin Ma-Player with the same code works 
 *           well.
